# Euchre

While doing research in the University of Rochester, I learned how to play an intruiging card game named euchre.

This program aims to simulate euchre to find the best possible ways to win. Included in the program is a class to create and shuffle a deck of cards, the outline of the AI for playing euchre, as well as the player class to execute options.
